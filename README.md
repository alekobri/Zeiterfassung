This is a basic app I've created for a friend so he can easily type in his working hours and export it as an Excel-file. Needless to say, 
he loves *Dr. Who*. 

## To Do
There are still some things I'd like to change:
- [ ] Export Umlaute such as ä, ö and ü correctly to the Excel-file

*It still needs to import images provided as a link as well*
- [ ] Loop through the Material(-kosten) divs more efficiently

*First I just waned to get it to work so he can use it*
- [ ] Use regex to prevent formatting issues

- [ ] Whatever else B.K. wishes for after testing the app

 :octopus: Any input is welcome  :octopus:
